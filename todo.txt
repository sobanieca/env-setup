```
#!/bin/bash
# Get the list of ports from the environment variable
PORTS=$1
# Split the ports by comma
IFS=',' read -ra PORT_ARRAY <<< "$PORTS"
# SSH connection details
SERVER="your_server_ip"
USERNAME="your_username"
SSH_OPTIONS="-N -f"
# Create the port forwarding string
PORT_FORWARDING=""
# Iterate over each port in the array
for PORT in "${PORT_ARRAY[@]}"; do
  # Map the port to localhost using 1-to-1 mapping
  PORT_MAPPING="$PORT:localhost:$PORT"
  
  # Concatenate the port forwarding mappings
  PORT_FORWARDING+=" -L $PORT_MAPPING"
done
# Open SSH connection with concatenated port forwarding
ssh $SSH_OPTIONS $PORT_FORWARDING $USERNAME@$SERVER
```
Now, when you run the script with the desired ports as an argument, it will open a single SSH connection with concatenated port forwarding:
```bash
./port_forwarding.sh "3000,4400,4401"
```
